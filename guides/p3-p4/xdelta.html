			<td id="left">If you've downloaded a Persona 3 or 4 mod from this site, it's likely in the format of an <b>Xdelta patch.</b>
			<br>A <b>patch</b> is a file that contains only the new changes between two files that have been compared. In this case, your original ISO file and the new modded one.
			<br><a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/"><b>Xdelta</b></a> is a program that makes these patches from two files by comparing them, so they can be later applied to the original file to turn it into the new file.
			<br><br>Basically, this saves you the trouble of having to follow the <a href="https://amicitia.github.io/guides/p3-p4/personapatcher">PersonaPatcher guide</a> in order to modify the ISO yourself, and also saves us from having to upload and download entire ISO files for every mod.

			One drawback is that you <b>need to have the exact same ISO</b> 
			that the mod was created with in order for the patch to work. At Amicitia,
			we tend to use the vanilla (non-undub) North American (NTSC) versions of each game.
			<br>One way to easily and reliably verify that you have the ISO you need is to check its MD5 hash.
			<br><br><a href="">Download and install HashTab for Windows</a> and right click your ISO file.
			Choose Properties from the dropdown, and select File Hashes. It may take awhile to calculate your hashes since ISOs are big files. If your MD5 hash matches the one below, any downloaded Xdelta patches from this site should work with your ISO.

		<td><h2>Applying Xdelta Patches</h2>
		When you download a patch, a copy of XDelta UI should be packaged alongside the patch in the ZIP.
		If not, <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/">you can download it from here.</a>
		Run the xdeltaUI.exe and stay on the <b>Apply Patch</b> tab.
		<br>For the patch, select the ".xdelta" file that came with the download.
		<br>For the source file, select your P3/P4 ".iso" file.
		<br>For the output file, choose where you want to save your new, modded .iso file to and name it whatever you want. Press patch and wait for it to finish!
		<br><br>The program may seem like it's frozen at this point, but it's working. <b>Just be patient. You'll get a notification when your new ISO is ready to play.</b>

			<h2>Creating Xdelta Patches</h2>
			If you have a mod that you want to share, the steps are pretty similar.
			Select the <b>Create Patch</b> tab in XDelta UI.
			<br>For original file, make sure your P3/P4 iso matches the MD5 hash on this page (or provide your own when you upload it just so people know what version to use) and select it.
			<br>For the modified file, select your newly compiled modded ISO.
			<br>For the patch destination, choose where you want your new ".xdelta" file to be saved to and name it whatever you want. Press patch and be patient, as it can take awhile and appear to have frozen (but it's working)!
			<br>
			<br>Feel free to share your .xdelta file via Mega or (preferably) Google Drive and share the link in a forum thread. We'd appreciate knowing what version of the game it works with, what files are changed in the mod, and the password if the file has one.
