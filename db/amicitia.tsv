p4g-pc-fmvs	mod	Slightly Enhanced FMV Mod	P4G	pelvisbass	6/17/2020	FMV	The goal of this mod is to make the FMV videos look slightly better however there is only so much that can be done in its current state. For some reason I will never understand atlus decided to encode the FMVs in game with the WMV2 Codec rather than the much more modern AVC codec used for the psvita version of the game. This results in some really bad compression and blocking which in some cases can be distracting. So I decided to use vapoursynth to try my best to fix it up. The results are not perfect as there is a small amount of detail loss and blockiness however in my opinion the results are much better than the originals. If you are interested in it I left the script I used for vapoursytnh as well as my ffmpeg settings in the readme.	 	https://i.slow.pics/PVByenB7.png	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PCTo-RivdmDzRSn8R1gpfBIseR3m400a/view

p3fes-escaperoutefuukaalwaysavailable	mod	Escape Route Fuuka Always Available	P3FES	Suit	03/28/2021	Quality of Life	This is mainly for players who have already beaten the game and are either playing a New Game+ or are starting The Answer. Since you have to level up Fuuka again for escape route, I've decided to make it available from the start, since leaving Tartarus or a door in The Answer is always up to luck.  This cheat does not account for Mitsuru, since she is never supposed to learn this skill, so she does not have extra choices in Tartarus, like music, unlike Fuuka. You also can't check Mitsuru's skills when talking to her, so it would seem that some modding would have to be done to get this idea to work.		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/605fadca08b2d.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/50318

p3fes-usingskillprogressionmodswitholdsaves	guide	Using Skill Progression mods with old saves	P3FES	Phoenix!	12/18/2020	Misc	This tutorial is a bit complex to explain, but it is incredibly simple in practice.<br><br>What is this tutorial for?<br>This tutorial is for mods such as Faithful Party Rebalance and The Answer Skill progression mod. It is intended solely for fixing the skill progression of party members, not Personas, albeit you can use this tutorial to have somewhat of the same effect.<br><br>The above two mods, along with future mods that change party skills/ levels, are flawed because they only work properly with party members that have not passed the level at which the new skills are learned. For example, if a mod makes Junpei learn Power Charge at level 60, and he is level 61 on your save file, then it is impossible for him to learn Power Charge without this tutorial.<br><br>These changes can add up if pre-existing moves have different levels. Take Junpei for instance:<br><br>• Cleave (innate) is replaced by Kill Rush (level 25) is replaced by Gigantic Fist (level 55)<br>If Junpei does not learn Kill Rush at level 25, he wil ... 		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/tuts/5fdd0fd70bfd7.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13659

(i.e. Persona Summoners plays while fighting Tartarus minibosses, since it played while fighting a Tartarus miniboss in the first movie)<br><br>This also has some artistic license just for fun, like Tartarus's themes being replaced with music from the movies based on whoever will be important during that block. Leftover tracks use the high quality versions from my other mod on here, to clear up any confusion. It also "adds" a few songs via messing with ambient sound loops (i.e. the Yakushima trip has music now, along with it's ocean and seagull sound effects)	<b>Updated 04/27/2021</b>	https://images.gamebanana.com/static/img/DefaultEmbeddables/Sound.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/sounds/52798

Is fine, doesn't really match Yu's character, and is just a bit of a weird thing to say in the moment. <br><br>The change done here reinforces the overall message of gender being irrelevant to Naoto's skill as a detective and fits the scene better. In order to do this I basically just flipped the second option to the first option so it's the new romance flag. I adjusted her responses to this afterward to make it more directed at Yu.

Also, the shading is a bit rough in some places, sorry, I am not the best at this.		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/604c7a021c896.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/250386

p4g-persona420goldenpc	mod	Persona 420 Golden (PC)	P4G	swindlesmccoop	08/02/2020	Yosuke Skin	Development History<br>When P4G was ported to PC, I knew that modding would run rampant. One of my favorite videos of all time is "Persona 420 Mod - Download in Description", and I remember seeing it get ported to the Vita. I had the feeling that someone would port it to PC, but I never imagined it would be me. There were two main issues with porting this in the first place. The first is that the pac files didn't actually change Yosuke at all, meaning I had to manually copy every single texture into literal hundreds of folders. In order to do that in the first place, I had to extract the TM2 files from all of the AMDs (which was quite a few), convert them to PNG, convert those PNGs to DDS, then copy the DDS' into the different folders. The second issue that arose is the fact that they completely overhauled the sound system in the PC port, opting to use XWB files in the SND directory, meaning I had to manually match up each and every individual file. Unfortunately, there were a couple issu ... 		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/5f2657d714a32.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/250384

p4g-marienoshoes	mod	Marie no shoes	P4G	Jayel	06/19/2020	Misc Skin	This mod replaces Marie's normal model with the no shoes variant. The no-hat version is unchanged so it will still have shoes. There were also some other Marie models in the files that I didn't replace because I didn't know what they were used for, so those might show up and still have shoes. Also I haven't tested all the animations so I have a slight fear that maybe one of them will randomly crash or something, so I'd save before talking to Marie if I were you. But who am I kidding?

p4g-theodorebossbattle	mod	Theodore Boss Battle	P4G	BarrelRoller64	08/28/2020	Misc Skin	Replaces Margaret's boss fight with a fight against Theodore instead. Theodore himself is partially voiced for English. I understand this may be annoying so removing his voice is optional, just delete the SND folder. He comes fully with his model, animations and text changed. This shouldn't impact any other mods you have but if it does, let me know and I will look into it. There is optional battle music that can be installed using the P4G BGM Enhancement. Any issues with the mod, let me know and I will attempt to fix them. Any additional instructions not featured here can be found in the readme.	<b>Updated 08/28/2020</b>	https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/5f494978b3f2d.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/250289

Basically this means that a previously 100% "complete" Compendium, will drop down to 99% until you register this new Persona.<br><br>No other Personas have been touched by this change. Nothing has been replaced or removed. I've simply adjusted the flag that tells the game whether this Persona can be registered so it behaves like the others in this regard.<br><br>NOTE: If you have any saves with this Persona already fused, you will need to remove it from your party and re-fuse it to make it registrable.<br><br>If my work has made your P4G experience more enjoyable, please consider showing your appreciation at my Ko-fi page.	<b>Updated 03/20/2021</b>	https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/60564e2c568a8.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/50901

Ever wanted to just cheese a boss with an insta-kill move? Well, this mod is for you!<br><br>The Light/Dark Neutral mod is a simple mod that makes most bosses neutral/resistant to Dark and Light skills. There are some exceptions like Shadow Rise and Kasumi-no-Okami.

I'm not familiar with TGE's modloader and Mod Compendium method, but I included the raw files (replacing the main boss theme) if you want to insert it that way. However, I haven't tested it that way, and can't really help there if something goes wrong. <br><br>I used the xacttool method, since that's what I'm more familiar with right now. I hope either method works for you. The command for that is: xacttool -wb "{your steam games folder/[Day or Persona 4 Golden]/snd folder/bgm.xwb file directory}" -r "NothingIsPromised.wav" -ls 860160 -le 7208960 -i 3<br>For the mini boss theme, replace the 3 at the end with 47.		https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/792245872259235850/842426608882679818/P4GSound.png	https://gamebanana.com/sounds/47849
p4g-fullversionoftimetomakehistory	mod	Full Version of Time To Make History	P4G	blivveries	06/27/2020	Music	Persona 4 Golden only loops the first verse of Time To Make History in-game. With the recent update to TGE's modloader, music mods are ridiculously simple, so I decided to replace it with the "Original Full Size Version" featured in P4D, which has the second verse and is currently the best "full" version of the theme that isn't also a remix.<br><br>This mod is structured to be compatible with the Mod Compendium. Just extract the zip file to the Mods\Persona4Golden\PC\ folder. There is also now a .wav version compatible with xacttool and P4G Music Manager.	<b>Updated 06/27/2020</b>	https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/792245872259235850/842426608882679818/P4GSound.png	https://gamebanana.com/sounds/47832

The area I'm covering is specifically for making sure the new model you bring into the game will work, it does not cover the process of rigging a model. What we want is to make sure the model is functional before starting heavy work like retexturing and rigging. You wouldn't want to put all that work into a model only to find out that its completely unusable and you have to scrap everything.<br><br>When bringing in models (usually from games outside Persona) to replace characters in Persona 5 (for example Michael Myers over Joker), it may not go so smoothly. There are chances you will experience errors in GFD Studio or have access violations/softlocks when loading the model in game. This walkthrough will make sure any model will work in game.<br><br>Required programs:<br><br>• 3DS Max (using 2018 in tutorial)<br>• TGE's Maxscript (using v0_15 in tutorial, link ... 	<b>Updated 03/16/2021</b>	https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/tuts/5fa37632a263a.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13590

p5d-p5dmodloading	guide	P5D Mod Loading	P5D	Pioziomgames	11/25/2020	Misc	This tutorial is for PS Vita and PS TV version of the game<br>First you will need a jailbroken vita/pstv, it's rather easy to do and most models can be even downgraded and you have a very minimal chance of getting banned.<br><br>1.Installing RePatch<br>If your device has firmware 3.60 and below you can skip this step (but it's unadvised because it sometimes doesn't work without it)<br>On your vita open VitaShell or MolecularShell, if you use VitaShell by pressing START you can open settings.

smt3-resolutionfix	mod	Resolution Fix	SMT3	bertie117	05/25/2021	Resource	For some reason Atlus capped the resolution at 1080p for this game. The resolution in the options only affects the HUD and UI, while the render scale option in the settings affects the game itself, and there are only three options: Low, which is 360p, medium, which is 720p, and high, which is 1080p. Considering this is a PS2 game capped at 30fps, you probably have a lot of GPU power going to waste.<br><br>I made this mod with the help of The Rhythm Thief on the steam forums:<br><br>https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2494134877<br><br>To install, download the file for whatever resolution you want and replace the "GameAssembly.dll" file in the game's directory with it. The resolution will replace the "High" preset; the others are untouched. Make sure to backup the original GameAssembly.dll file.		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/60accc3c4c993.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/289436
