p4g-pc-fmvs	mod	Slightly Enhanced FMV Mod	P4G	pelvisbass	6/17/2020	FMV	The goal of this mod is to make the FMV videos look slightly better however there is only so much that can be done in its current state. For some reason I will never understand atlus decided to encode the FMVs in game with the WMV2 Codec rather than the much more modern AVC codec used for the psvita version of the game. This results in some really bad compression and blocking which in some cases can be distracting. So I decided to use vapoursynth to try my best to fix it up. The results are not perfect as there is a small amount of detail loss and blockiness however in my opinion the results are much better than the originals. If you are interested in it I left the script I used for vapoursytnh as well as my ffmpeg settings in the readme.	 	https://i.slow.pics/PVByenB7.png	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PCTo-RivdmDzRSn8R1gpfBIseR3m400a/view

p3p-escaperoutefuukaalwaysavailable	Mod	Escape Route Fuuka Always Available	P3P	Suit	03/28/2021	Quality of Life 	This is mainly for players who have already beaten the game and are either playing a New Game+ or are starting The Answer. Since you have to level up Fuuka again for escape route, I've decided to make it available from the start, since leaving Tartarus or a door in The Answer is always up to luck.  This cheat does not account for Mitsuru, since she is never supposed to learn this skill, so she does not have extra choices in Tartarus, like music, unlike Fuuka. You also can't check Mitsuru's skills when talking to her, so it would seem that some modding would have to be done to get this idea to work.		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/605fadca08b2d.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/50318

For this reason, the icon for passive skills has been left unchanged.		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/60c833e94862d.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/55650
p4g-slimfont	Guide	Slim Font	P4G	Pixelguin	05/31/2021	Font UI	Persona 4 Golden has a wider font than the PS2 version of Persona 4, presumably to make the text easier to read on the small PS Vita screen. However, it's much too large for a PC monitor or even a television screen.<br><br>This mod replaces P4G's font with the slimmer Skip Std-B font, slightly edited to fit texture height limits. Each character was individually typed and spaced using Photoshop and PersonaEditor, which also fixes some overlapping glyph issues from the original font.		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/60c8345762531.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/50903

p4g-cranegamerebalanced	Guide	Crane Game Rebalanced	P4G	AnimatedSwine37	05/30/2021	Misc 	This mod rebalances the crane game to make it less tedious. <br><br>Normally, you would pay 100 yen for one try. Days that end with 0, 2 and 6 (10th, 12th, 6th etc.) allow the protagonist to play twice per attempt. The 30th of each month is a "miracle day" that boosts your chances of getting a prize.<br><br>With this mod however, every day behaves like a miracle day with the increased win rate and you get two tries per attempt. In practical terms, it should take far fewer attempts to get the grand prizes when they're available than normal. Luck is still a factor.<br><br>To balance the increased odds, the price of play has also been upped from 100 to 500 per attempt (two tries).		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/60b30fe3a9b02.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/290821

This mod aims to change that with a completely custom controller UI.<br><br>Compatible with all controller types (Steam Controller users will need to configure their gamepad in Big Picture settings).<br><br>Note: If you are using a next-generation controller (Xbox Series or PS5) and the game is not responding to button presses, open the Steam Properties window for P4G and set Steam Input Per-Game Setting to Forced On.<br><br>List of Improvements<br><br>Universal<br><br>• Bigger, more legible font used for all text<br>• Classic white "Check!!"

However, it's much too large for a PC monitor or even a television screen.<br><br>This mod replaces P4G's font with Linux Biolinum Bold, the font from Persona 5 Strikers. Each character was individually typed and spaced using Photoshop and PersonaEditor, which also fixes some overlapping glyph issues from the original font.

This will only be fixed once I work out how to get inactive party members to level up which may not be for a long time (eventually hopefully). <br><br>A Reloaded II mod that adds XP sharing to Persona 4 Golden so inactive party members don't get left behind.<br><br>Installation<br>As this is a Reloaded II mod it can be installed directly from Reloaded under the download mods section. Alternitavley you can manually install it by extracting the zip into Reloaded's mods folder. Once installed, go to the p4g section and enable it. This mod does not rely on p4g modloader (or any other mod), unlike the majority of mods so it can be used completely on its own if you so wish. <br><br>Things To Note<br> ... 		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/60029a33a126b.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/50926

It works with both the High and Low quality cutscene setting.<br><br>Instead of replacing the movie files entirely with the mod loader, this is a simple Inaba patch that redirects p4ctop3_e.usm to p4ctop1.usm. This removes the need to include movie files in the mod at all and should improve compatibility for those having trouble with movie replacements.		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/60cab536aad00.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/50955

If you don't want to face the Reaper, you can simply dismiss the prompt and move to another floor. This will reset the chest counter back to zero. Returning to the entrance with or without dismissing the prompt will also reset the counter.<br><br>In the downloads are different versions that combine other mods.  Use that version instead of both of them combined.  Even more co ... 		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/5fbf60ab1d2c7.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/50918

It doesn't do anything except set flag 9999 to ON when you select female. This number was chosen at random as an example and I don't know if it's used for anything else or not. <br><br>The .flow and .msg I used are included if you wanted to do any edits. To recompile, download AtlusScriptCompiler and overwrite the Library folder with this one. Then use the GUI to convert the .flow to .bf.<br><br>For an actual mod that utilizes this feature, you would probably need to make Reloaded II patches for the game that check the flag whenever it loads assets related to the player (models, voices, UI graphics...) and redirect them to the replacement.		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/5fb47a9adb011.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/50913

p4g-persona420goldenpc	Guide	Persona 420 Golden (PC)	P4G	swindlesmccoop	08/02/2020	Yosuke Skin	Development History<br>When P4G was ported to PC, I knew that modding would run rampant. One of my favorite videos of all time is "Persona 420 Mod - Download in Description", and I remember seeing it get ported to the Vita. I had the feeling that someone would port it to PC, but I never imagined it would be me. There were two main issues with porting this in the first place. The first is that the pac files didn't actually change Yosuke at all, meaning I had to manually copy every single texture into literal hundreds of folders. In order to do that in the first place, I had to extract the TM2 files from all of the AMDs (which was quite a few), convert them to PNG, convert those PNGs to DDS, then copy the DDS' into the different folders. The second issue that arose is the fact that they completely overhauled the sound system in the PC port, opting to use XWB files in the SND directory, meaning I had to manually match up each and every individual file.

But aren't you tired of always seeing them in glasses whenever you're fighting shadows in dungeons? Well why don't we spice things up a bit this time! Introducing the No Glasses Mod!<br><br>Overview: <br><br>This mod is pretty simple, all it does is make the glasses invisible whenever you're in a dungeon. This means that your characters will still be wearing the glasses in cutscenes and other events. This way it still kind of makes sense to the story. I know what you're thinking though, "how will the Investigation Team be able to see through the fog inside the TV!?!" The answer is simple, with advanced technology, they are now able to wear contact lenses :D!<br><br>Yu<br><br>Yosuke<br><br>Chie <br><br> <br>My Wifey~!!! &lt;3&lt;3<br><br>Yukiko <br><br>Kanji <br><br>Naoto<br> <br><br>For The Future:  <br><br>• Edit battle icons to remove glasses <br>• Toggle ON/OFF option for specific costumes <br><br>If there's any issues with the mod, don't hesit ... 		https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/5f011ed787d81.jpg	https://gamebanana.com/mods/250299

Considering this is a PS2 game capped at 30fps, you probably have a lot of GPU power going to waste.<br><br>I made this mod with the help of The Rhythm Thief on the steam forums:<br><br>https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2494134877<br><br>To install, download the file for whatever resolution you want and replace the "GameAssembly.dll" file in the game's directory with it.
