  <p>The best way to keep in touch with other <b>Amicitia</b> modders
  <br>is through our <b>Discord server.</b> All of our discussion has been
  <br>facilitated through Discord since January 2016, and we've built
  <br>a unique, active community that's always willing to help.
  <br>
  <h1>Before Joining...</h1>
  <p>You can use the invite link below to become a member of our server.
  <br>If you don't have a Discord account yet, you may need to make one and verify your email.
  <br>Please keep in mind we have a few <b>ground rules</b> to keep everything running smoothly.
  <br><b>By joining, you agree to follow these rules while participating.</b>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
	<li><b>No Explicit or Disturbing Content.</b> Absolutely <b>No NSFW</b> imagery, including nudity, gore, blood, or violence. <b>No mention</b> of loli/shota/sexual degredation against men or women (as text or images).</li>
<li><b>No Hate Speech of Any Kind.</b> Nothing homophobic, ableist, transphobic, racial, or discrimination by gender, identity or religion is allowed.</li>
<li><b>Show Respect</b>. Bullying, flaming, threats and/or personal insults toward other users will get you muted or kicked. Don't instigate for the sole purpose of getting a reaction. If someone asks you to drop a touchy subject, don't discuss it any further no matter who they are.</li>
<li><b>No Ban Evasion.</b> You will be banned without question if you're suspected of bypassing moderation (by using alt accounts or avoiding the spam/word filter).</li>
<li><b>No Spam.</b> Don't repeatedly post images, phrases or symbols. Keep things in their proper channels. Politics & venting belong in #serious-talk only.</li>
<li><b>Don't share info</b>  that's not yours or is personally identifiable (phone numbers, IPs, full names, locations). You may post your own photos or use your own name, but always ask permission before posting someone else's. <b>Use your best discretion.</b></li>
</ol>
<h2>Moderation</h2>
Remember, speaking in our server is a privilege, not a right.
<br>Upon each infraction, you will receive a <b>warn.</b>
<ul>
<li><b>After 2 warns</b> you may be muted.</li>
<li><b>After 3 warns</b> you may be kicked.</li>
<li><b>After 4 warns</b> you may be banned.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bots and Filters</h2>
A healthy debate is certainly welcome here. However, we employ spam and word filters 
<br>to weed out slurs and unwanted discussion topics outside of #serious-talk. 
<br>You will not be penalized for accidentally triggering these filters,
<br>but <b>clear attempts to bypass them will result in a warn.</b>
